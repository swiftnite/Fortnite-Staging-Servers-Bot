## Twitter Developer Account Setup
You must have a Twitter developer account which you can sign up for at https://developer.twitter.com/
Once signed up, apply for elevated access if you do not already have it (can be found under project one)
If accepted, go to overview (under projects & apps) and create a project.

Once you have created your app within the project scroll to user authentication settings inside the app and click set up.
Inside you must select read and write permissions (permissions) and web app, automated app or bot (type).
For the required callback/redirect URL and website URL, the URL can be anything (you can even just use your Twitter eg. ```https://twitter.com/swiftnite```)

Once saved, navigate to keys and tokens and regenerate API key and secret, fill these out in ```config.py``` (consumerKey and consumerSecretKey respectively)
Navigate to keys and tokens again and generate Access token and secret, fill these out in ```config.py``` (accessToken and accessTokenSecret respectively)

Your app's permissions **MUST** have **Read + Write** or else it will not post!!
